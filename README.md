# Saltwater
An experimental CTRPlugin for running mods in Rhythm Heaven Megamix, with focus on supporting all regional versions of the game and loading mods in a modular way.

This tool is part of the **SpiceRack** project, which aims to create more advanced tools for Rhythm Heaven Megamix modding. Join our Discord server for information at https://discord.gg/xAKFPaERRG !

Join the RHModding server for information and support regarding modding Rhythm Heaven games in general: https://discord.com/invite/ps4rq53

## How to use
Check [HowTo.md](HowTo.md) for information on how to install the plugin and load mods. **MODS FOR SALTWATER NEED TO BE COMPILED SPECIFICALLY FOR SALTWATER**

If you want to build mods, you'll need a specific fork of Tickompiler for the packing step, which you can find [here](https://github.com/patataofcourse/Tickompiler/releases/latest)
