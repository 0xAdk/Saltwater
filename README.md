# Saltwater
An experimental CTRPlugin for running mods in Rhythm Heaven Megamix, with focus on supporting all regional versions of the game and loading mods in a modular way.

This tool is part of the **SpiceRack** project, which aims to create more advanced tools for Rhythm Heaven Megamix modding. Join our Discord server for information at https://discord.gg/xAKFPaERRG !

## How to use
Don't use Saltwater on its own, you'll need [Barista](https://github.com/patataofcourse/Barista) as well!

(WIP)

## Building
You'll need the following:

- devKitARM, latest
- libctru, latest
- CTR Plugin Framework (libctrpf) v0.7.4
- 3gxtool v1.1

The first two can be gotten through [dkP pacman](https://devkitpro.org/wiki/devkitPro_pacman) (install `3ds-dev`), and the last two can be gotten from [Nanquitas' Discord server](https://discord.gg/z4ZMh27). Links to the GitLab releases will be included in this readme soon.

Run `make` to build the plugin.

## Credits
* Nanquitas for the Luma3DS plugin loader, CTRPF, and the template
* PabloMK7 for CTRPF, the template, CTGP-7 (which inspired this project), and a LOT of support (ty)
* NeoBeo for RHMPatch
* Everyone who's cheered on and helped with testing, thank you so much, everyone <3

###### RHMPatch was released in 2017 guys it's kinda outdated
